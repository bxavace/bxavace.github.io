description: An essay on how I relate golden hour and nostalgia.
---

Golden hour gives off this soft glowing feeling that I once have first felt when I was young. This phenomenon certainly happens when it's not too cloudy by sunset and the hues of the light rays is just enough to give off _liminal space_ vibes. Not to mention the lack of background noise during this hour, I immediately get transported to the time when I'm still clueless to the harshness of the reality, as if my blissful ignorance protects me from being reached by it.

This stagnant period just pulls these huge waves of nostalgia that makes you wish your life could've been as easy to repeat and review as a video game. It is peaceful, but it also breaks you apart. It's bittersweet, so to speak. Sucks that the only thing left that no one else, except yourself, could get from you yourself, are the memories that comes rushing at this tranquil hour.

This is why I have been since into `dreamcore`, `liminal spaces`, and similar niches!
