The Navajo code talkers amazed me the most, while the quantum chapter tickled my mind the most. This is a fascinating, light, introductory read on the history (and future) of cryptography. I have yet to start the cipher challenge though. One insightful lesson I learned about this book is that one should be 67786164 66206167 66676120 61676166 782067 about something if they want to pursue something great. Buying this second-hand book was definitely worth it! Note: key is somewhere around in this entry."

            "review": "This is my first book from Haruki Murakami and I haven't even read anything about Franz Kafka yet so I thought this might be challenging a bit. I loved the alternating turn in between chapters, it helped in building momentum. If it was focused on one character, it'd be just boring and confusing. Albeit I ended up having so many questions about the novel. Upon further research, it's actually a magical realism and that the story is subject to interpretation. While it was tiring to find relevant theories in Reddit after, one thing is for sure: the story is creatively written. I was immersed in Kafka's world, and while I do not fully understand the reason why things came to be, I did enjoy the experience. Me not understanding the book fully is not the typical \"I hate this book, I didn't understand anything!\" It's more of a \"I love this book, everything's confusing but fascinating at the same time!\". I am not a fan of metaphysics but the novel made me feel and appreciate it. Not the Oedipal theme though -- that's just disgustinGGG. Oh and yes, I liked Archduke Trio!"

As someone who dwells in nostalgia and the idea of going back in time -- not to change anything, but to experience it once more -- the book gave me perspective on dealing with such matters. The climax of every chapter is a tear-jerker!"

I'm always a fan of pre-historic animals, and this book gave me a glimpse of what it's like to live in a world where dinosaurs still exist. I sensed a bit of racism in the book considering it was written last century, but yeah, it's a good read! The idea that there exists creatures we thought were gone a long time ago in such a remote place is not so unlikely -- I mean, latest articles about LIDAR and undiscovered places just being discovered now strengthen the possibility that they still exist!"

Will re-read this again!"
