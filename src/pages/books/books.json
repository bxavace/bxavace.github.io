As someone who dwells in nostalgia and the idea of going back in time -- not to change anything, but to experience it once more -- the book gave me perspective on dealing with such matters. The climax of every chapter is a tear-jerker!"

            "review": "I am not sure if I read this book this year or last year (blame iTunes for ruining my storage!) but I remember enjoying the fantasy and adventure in this book. I'm always a fan of pre-historic animals, and this book gave me a glimpse of what it's like to live in a world where dinosaurs still exist. I sensed a bit of racism in the book considering it was written last century, but yeah, it's a good read! The idea that there exists creatures we thought were gone a long time ago in such a remote place is not so unlikely -- I mean, latest articles about LIDAR and undiscovered places just being discovered now strengthen the possibility that they still exist!"

Not related to the book: reading this gave me a boost in confidence that I can actually read and finish a book! That's why I made a 'books' section to keep that reading habit going. Will re-read this again!"
