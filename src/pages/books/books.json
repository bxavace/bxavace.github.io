            "review": "The book is a light read; I enjoyed the short separate chapters that left me inspired and hopeful what happens next. As someone who dwells in nostalgia and the idea of going back in time -- not to change anything, but to experience it once more -- the book gave me perspective on dealing with such matters. The climax of every chapter is a tear-jerker!"
